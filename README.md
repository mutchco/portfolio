# Tyler Mutch Portfolio Website

A static SPA built with [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) that showcases the work done by me (Tyler Mutch), it uses zero dependencies other than preact and preact router.
It uses AWS Api Gateway and AWS Lambda to send lead generation emails and Google Analytics for user engagement tracking
